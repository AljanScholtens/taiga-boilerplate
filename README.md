# Taiga

Taiga is a small HTML/PostCSS framework working with Nunjucks for starting a living component library and style guide (foundation for a design system).
It's mobile-first based on the principles of ITCSS and [BEM](http://bem.info).

A getting started guide can be found in the style guide after installing it locally.

## Background

As UI designer and front-end developer I wanted to have a simple boilerplate to set up a small foundation of a design system with a simple living component library for a new web product. Use it, rebuild it and work from there, do not try to update Taiga.

Taiga is inspired by these awesome people: Harry Roberts, Nathan Curtis, Brad Frost and Dominic Nguyen.
