Taiga Boilerplate
====================

Taiga Boilerplate is the extended version of Taiga Grid for starting a new web project. With a clean folder structure and basic modules it's a head start for UI designers who code.

* Includes Taiga Grid (https://github.com/StudioWolf/taiga-grid)
* Mobile first
* Set of simple mixins
* Modular with Smacss
* Touch and mobile ready
* Basic components like forms, tables, buttons etc.

Changes
---------------------

* 25 october: buttons, forms etc can be found in the folder 'shared-components'. Modules like 'product', 'blog-article', 'shopping-cart' can be created in the folder 'modules'.

Why Taiga Boilerplate?
---------------------

As an interface designer I had the problem with most other boilerplates that they are created for developers. You'll get everything you need to build a prototype rapidly, but adjusting and adding components and design can be difficult. That's why we build our own boilerplate and shaped Taiga while looking at HTML5Boilerplate, Twitter Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation and others.

Set up Taiga Boilerplate
---------------------

* Taiga Grid: The core of Taiga Boilerplate is Taiga Grid, so please read how to work with the grid first.
* Sass: Download Sass and runn `sass --watch stylesheets:stylesheets --style compressed`.
* Modular CSS: Taiga Boilerplate works with modular CSS. To fully understand this principle you should read the Smacss book by Jonathan Snook.
