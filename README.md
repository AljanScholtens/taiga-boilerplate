## Background

As UI designer and front-end developer I wanted to have a simple boilerplate to set up a small foundation of a design system with a simple living component library for a new web product. Use it, rebuild it and work from there, do not try to update Taiga.

Taiga is inspired by these awesome people: Harry Roberts, Nathan Curtis, Brad Frost and Dominic Nguyen.
